# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the current issue where users are redirected to a generic home page after successful login instead of being directed to their personal profile page. The system should provide a more personalized and intuitive post-login experience by automatically navigating users to their profile dashboard where they can view their reputation, questions, answers, and account activity.

## Glossary

- **Auth_System**: The authentication system that manages user login, session, and user state
- **Profile_Page**: The user's personal dashboard located at `/users/{userId}/{userSlug}` showing reputation, questions, and answers
- **Login_Flow**: The complete process from login form submission to final page redirection
- **User_Session**: The authenticated state containing user data and session information

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be automatically redirected to my profile page after successful login, so that I can immediately see my account dashboard and activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in, THE Auth_System SHALL redirect the user to their Profile_Page
2. THE Auth_System SHALL construct the profile URL using the user's ID and slugified name
3. IF the user data is available after login, THEN THE Auth_System SHALL navigate to `/users/{userId}/{userSlug}`
4. THE Login_Flow SHALL complete within 3 seconds of successful authentication
5. WHERE the user has an existing session, THE Auth_System SHALL redirect to the Profile_Page on page load

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully during post-login redirection, so that I have a reliable login experience even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the user profile URL cannot be constructed, THEN THE Auth_System SHALL redirect to the home page as fallback
2. WHEN profile redirection fails, THE Auth_System SHALL log the error and use fallback navigation
3. THE Auth_System SHALL maintain the current session state regardless of redirection outcome
4. IF the Profile_Page is not accessible, THEN THE Auth_System SHALL redirect to the questions page as secondary fallback
5. THE Login_Flow SHALL never leave the user on the login page after successful authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent redirection behavior across different login methods, so that I have the same experience whether I use email/password or social login.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Auth_System SHALL apply the same redirection logic for all login methods
2. WHEN using email/password login, THE Auth_System SHALL redirect to Profile_Page
3. WHEN using social login (Google/GitHub), THE Auth_System SHALL redirect to Profile_Page
4. THE Auth_System SHALL ensure user data is fully loaded before attempting redirection
5. WHERE login occurs from different entry points, THE Auth_System SHALL maintain consistent redirection behavior
